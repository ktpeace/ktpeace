<h2>🤖 About Me As a Software Engineer</h2>

I completed the intensive App Academy Open fullstack bootcamp in 2022. 🎊 It was a lot of hard work, but I learned a ton. AAO asked me to be a Discord mod (though I am too busy at the moment achieving my coding dreams) and I continue to work with them on bootcamp improvements.


Since then, I have been programming with other students and solo to cement and expand my skills in preparation for a career in the field: solving problems, learning new concepts and languages, and making working apps. Some of my strengths are that I am humble, determined, and constantly refactoring myself.

<h3>💟 Values</h3>

Due in part to former work at a Commission for the Blind, I am keenly interested in gaining accessibility expertise. I also have great admiration for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and take Internet privacy seriously. AI is a major concern both in terms of everyone's job security and ethical design/training, but it is inevitable, so I would like to work on helping build positive AI someday (ref. Baymax 💙). And of course, I want to write code in a way that makes things easy for my fellow developers.

<h2>👩 About Me As A Human</h2>

*I acknowledge that software engineers are probably humans.*

Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time talking to friends and walking in the woods. My primary life passion is writing fiction, especially in the genre of magical realism. Other hobbies include foreign languages, car mechanics, world history, karate, the constellations, juggling, guitar, anatomy, sketching, and plant identification. Lately I have mostly just been focusing on programming, though. I try to do vipassana meditation daily. 

<h3>🐎 Reading: Don Quixote (it's funny! no really!)</h3>
<details><summary>Click here for evidence that Don Quixote is funny</summary> 

“Are you, sir knight, in love perchance?” asked he of the Grove of Don Quixote.

“By mischance I am,” replied Don Quixote; “though the ills arising from well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than misfortunes.”

“That is true,” returned he of the Grove, “if scorn did not unsettle our reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge.”

“I was never scorned by my lady,” said Don Quixote.

“Certainly not,” said Sancho, who stood close by, “for my lady is as a lamb, and softer than a roll of butter.”

<details><summary>um</summary> possibly that's made it worse</details>

- A Confederacy of Dunces is a good Don Quixote when you don't feel like reading 350,000 antiquated words 🌭🍩
- I also recommend Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Jon Klassen's This Is Not My Hat (spoiler alert: it's not his hat)

<h3>🗄️ Watching: Alice in Borderland</h3>

- Fave Netflix show: Midnight Mass
- Fave movie: A Thousand Clowns
- Fave show as a child: Probably the animated X-Men (best while eating Lucky Charms)


<h3>🎮 Playing: Divinity: Original Sin II</h3>

- I also play darts with my dad sometimes, which has way fewer dwarves
