<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Kat. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Welcome to my profile!</h1>

<h2>ü§ñ About Me As a Software Engineer</h2>

<h3>‚õ∞Ô∏è My Journey</h3>

<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/katherine-peace" target="blank"> ![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/linkedin-%230077B5.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white) </a> 

In 2022, I completed the self-driven, intensive App Academy Open fullstack bootcamp. üéä AAO asked me to be a Discord mod and I continued to work with them on bootcamp improvements. After that, I did an internship with a startup company named Amotions. In 2023, I began working at the AGI development company Neuraville in Pittsburgh.

<h3>üíü Values</h3>

Due in part to former work at a Commission for the Blind, I am keenly interested in gaining accessibility expertise. I also have great admiration for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and take Internet privacy seriously. AI is a major concern both in terms of everyone's job security and ethical design/training, but it is inevitable, so I would like to work on helping build positive AI someday (ref. Baymax üíô). I appreciate companies that consider their environmental impact. Essentially, I'll be happy doing anything that helps people or other living beings. And of course, I want to write code in a way that makes things easy for my fellow developers.

<h2>üë© About Me As A Human</h2>

*I acknowledge that software engineers are probably humans.*

Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time talking to friends and walking in the woods. My primary life passion is writing fiction, especially in the genre of magical realism. Other hobbies include foreign languages, car mechanics, world history, karate, the constellations, juggling, guitar, anatomy, sketching, and plant identification. I try to do vipassana meditation daily. 

<h3>üêé Reading: Don Quixote (it's funny! no really!)</h3>
<details><summary>Click here for evidence that Don Quixote is funny</summary> 

‚ÄúAre you, sir knight, in love perchance?‚Äù asked he of the Grove of Don Quixote.

‚ÄúBy mischance I am,‚Äù replied Don Quixote; ‚Äúthough the ills arising from well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than misfortunes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù returned he of the Grove, ‚Äúif scorn did not unsettle our reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was never scorned by my lady,‚Äù said Don Quixote.

‚ÄúCertainly not,‚Äù said Sancho, who stood close by, ‚Äúfor my lady is as a lamb, and softer than a roll of butter.‚Äù

<details><summary>um</summary> possibly that's made it worse</details>

</details>

- A Confederacy of Dunces is a good Don Quixote when you don't feel like reading 350,000 antiquated words üå≠üç©
- I also recommend Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Jon Klassen's This Is Not My Hat (spoiler alert: it's not his hat)

<h3>üóÑÔ∏è Watching: Alice in Borderland</h3>

- Fave Netflix show: Alice in Borderland or Midnight Mass
- Fave movie: A Thousand Clowns
- Fave show as a child: Probably the animated X-Men (best while eating Lucky Charms)


<h3>üéÆ Playing: Baldur's Gate III</h3>

- Where is my owlbear cub though?! üòø
