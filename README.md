<h2>ü§ñ Me As a Software Engineer</h2>

I recently finished the intensive App Academy Open fullstack bootcamp. I was so active in the online community that people often mistook me for an employee! AAO asked me to be a Discord mod (though I am too busy at the moment--achieving my coding dreams) and I continue to work with them on bootcamp improvements.


Since then, I have been programming with other students and solo to cement and expand my skills in preparation for a career in the field. Some of my strengths are that I am humble, determined, and constantly refactoring myself.

*<p align="center">üìÜ What I'm Up To on 12/20</p>*

- Learning Docker & Fly.io to host the backend of a simple [app](https://github.com/ktpeace/milkwall) whose page of text any visitor can edit for all. It uses React, Express, and a JSON database for its two values. The frontend is hosted on Netlify

- Cementing data structures and algorithms by teaming up with a former bootcamp student to follow Frontend Mentor's DS&A course and work on relevant Leetcodes together

- Building the frontend of a commissioned project

<h3>üíü Values</h3>

Due in part to former work at a Commission for the Blind, I am keenly interested in gaining accessibility expertise. I also have great admiration for the Electronic Frontier Foundation and take Internet privacy seriously. And of course, I want to write code in a way that makes things easy for my fellow developers.

<h2>üë© Me As A Human</h2>

*I acknowledge that software engineers are probably humans.*

Outside of coding, I spend a lot of time talking to friends and walking in the woods. My primary life passion is writing fiction, especially in the genre of magical realism. Other hobbies include foreign languages, car mechanics, world history, karate, the constellations, juggling, guitar, anatomy, sketching, and plant identification. Lately I have mostly just been focusing on programming, though. I try to do vipassana meditation daily. 

<h3>üêé Reading: Don Quixote (it's funny! no really!)</h3>
<details><summary>Click here for evidence that Don Quixote is funny</summary> 

‚ÄúAre you, sir knight, in love perchance?‚Äù asked he of the Grove of Don Quixote.

‚ÄúBy mischance I am,‚Äù replied Don Quixote; ‚Äúthough the ills arising from well-bestowed affections should be esteemed favours rather than misfortunes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is true,‚Äù returned he of the Grove, ‚Äúif scorn did not unsettle our reason and understanding, for if it be excessive it looks like revenge.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was never scorned by my lady,‚Äù said Don Quixote.

‚ÄúCertainly not,‚Äù said Sancho, who stood close by, ‚Äúfor my lady is as a lamb, and softer than a roll of butter.‚Äù

<details><summary>um</summary> possibly that's made it worse</details>

</details>

- A Confederacy of Dunces is a good Don Quixote when you don't feel like reading 350,000 antiquated words üå≠üç©
- I also recommend Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and Jon Klassen's This Is Not My Hat (spoiler alert: it's not his hat)

<h3>üç¥ Watching: Knives Out 2 (sooon!)</h3>

- Fave Netflix show: Midnight Mass
- Fave movie: A Thousand Clowns
- Fave show as a child: Probably the animated X-Men


<h3>üéÆ Playing: Divinity: Original Sin II</h3>

- I also play darts with my dad sometimes, which has way fewer dwarves
